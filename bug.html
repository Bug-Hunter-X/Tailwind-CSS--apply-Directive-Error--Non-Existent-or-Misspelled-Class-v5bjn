This error occurs when using Tailwind's `@apply` directive with a class that doesn't exist or is misspelled.  For example:

```html
<div class="bg-blue-500 @apply text-center">
</div>
```

If `text-center` is not defined in your Tailwind configuration, this will cause a build error or unexpected behavior depending on your setup.  The error message is not always clear and might appear as a general CSS parsing issue.
